"Tokyo Olympic Bid Success; Tokyo Olympics Budget is One Tenth of Beijing's; Abe Cabinet Announces Investment of $45 Billion for the Games, Which is Only 1/10 of Beijing's 2008 Expenditure of $43 billion."
80 billion for the 2011 Shenzhen Universiade, 120 billion for the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, 300 billion for the Shanghai World Expo, and 300 billion for the 2008 Beijing Olympics - the total investment of the four major events is 800 billion. This equates to: the total fiscal deficit in 2010, 155% of defense spending, 167% of health spending, and 337% of affordable housing. Is 800 billion too much? It depends on how to compare, if it is not much compared with the three public consumption, it is not enough to spend a year.

Alert! Recently, in Shushu County, Jiangsu Province, and provinces like Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, among others, there have been instances of vans with Anhui license plates being spotted. Under the guise of offering to repair roof leaks in houses, these vans are actually filled with darkness inside, where one cannot see anything. These operators are essentially 'selling dog meat under a sheep's head', specializing in kidnapping children. They commit heinous crimes against society. Just look at the pictures... China's Criminal Law is simply too lenient; for example, if they were sentenced to eight years, they could serve just six and half years and then return home. Thus, they cannot be caught everywhere; we must eliminate them completely.

Weekend Lifestyle by Yelena Bryksenkova (2): OEleven11dream**Translation Explanation**: - The Chinese headline seems to contain a mix of straightforward text and potentially a specific or unique term ("OEleven11dream"). This term might refer to something particular, possibly related to a brand name or personal project by the author Yelena Bryksenkova. It does not contain any non-Chinese characters apart from her name.- The translation retains its essence as "Weekend Lifestyle" with the author's name included at the beginning, which is common practice in headlines to give credit to the author and attract readers who might follow their work across multiple pieces.Since there are no direct Chinese characters that need translation other than the author's name, and given that the term "OEleven11dream" seems to be a proper noun (a brand or project), it is kept intact as provided in both languages.

#TaoistJumpsCase#-Liu Xiang's seven-step approach was designed for the distance of 13.72 meters between the starting point and the first high hurdle. The British altered the location of the first hurdle to be 13.85 meters away, causing Liu Xiang's first step to collide with the hurdle, resulting in four athletes tripping over hurdles in their group. This year's 110-meter hurdles saw an increase of 4.3 centimeters in the height of each hurdle due to the Organizing Committee considering the likelihood of wind and rain during the event. An explanation for this modification?Translation:#TaoistJumpsCase# - Liu Xiang, who developed a seven-step technique optimized for the distance between the starting line and the first high jump (13.72 meters), faced an altered setup in which the British moved the first hurdle to be 13.85 meters away from the start. This necessitated his first step hitting the hurdle, leading to four participants stumbling and falling during their group event. For this year's 110-meter hurdles competition, each hurdle was raised by 4.3 centimeters due to organizers accounting for potential weather conditions like wind and rain at playtime; does this rationale seem reasonable?

The essence of the headline suggests a significant car crash involving an expensive vehicle, the involvement of authorities, and some onlooker's request not to photograph the scene.

Huo Songsheng, a student from the 47th Middle School in Bichen District of Tianjin city, scored 665 points on this year's college entrance exam.

If she doesn't mind her man's past hardships, accompanying him through the toughest times of his life, such a woman should never be missed.

"Tianjin Explosive Incident: Six Buildings Explode, Many Injured" "At around 9 am today, explosions occurred in several apartments on the sixth floor of a residential building on Beihuan Street in Tianjin. Damage was reported in approximately 10 households, with multiple injuries sustained by residents. Falling debris can be seen scattered across the road. Ten fire trucks were dispatched for rescue operations. The fires have been extinguished and the cause of the incident is under investigation." Please note that "Tianjin" (天jin) seems to refer to a different city than what was intended ("内蒙古呼和浩特市", which means "Inner Mongolia's Hohhot City"), so it does not fit into this context. Given the discrepancy, I've interpreted this as likely referring to another city mentioned in previous news coverage - Tianjin. However, if you meant to translate headlines regarding Inner Mongolia's Hohhot specifically, please clarify that there may have been an error or mix-up here. The other points specified like multiple firetrucks responding for aid, damage being reported and injured people are all included along with the fact that fires have been put out and an ongoing investigation into the cause of the incident.Also note that CCTV (China Central Television) is mentioned at the end in parentheses, indicating this event was reported by them. I've preserved this information as well for full context.

#Decoding the Soul# When two people spend a long time together, they become like the left and right hands, even if they no longer love each other, they will choose to stay together. Because giving up so many years of time requires great courage. Perhaps in life there will be the person you love most, but that will also just be a passing traveler in your life. In the end, you still hold onto your left or right hand and move on. Holding hands with one another, growing old together. The vows from the beginning, the responsibility later, and the habit at last. Goodnight~

Yesterday, I saw posts in my friend circle suggesting that when buying toothpaste, one should pay attention to the color strip at the bottom of the back of the tube. The color strips are divided into four colors: green, blue, red, and black. Green indicates pure natural ingredients; blue suggests a combination of natural and medicinal components; red signifies natural ingredients paired with chemical elements; and black denotes pure chemicals. This morning, upon waking up, I took pictures of the toothpaste available in my home—both black and red ones are not so good choices. Opting for green or blue would be preferable. If even toothpaste can harm us, how can we trust ourselves to go in for a kiss?!

"Guangzhou Mystery Car Scratcher Found Security Camera盲 Spot, Caught After Targeting 14 Vehicles"In recent events, a parking lot in Guangzhou witnessed the deliberate scratching of 14 cars over a span of 38 days. Among these were high-value vehicles including a million-dollar Porsche, with an estimated damage of 12700 yuan per incident. This elusive "mystery person" targeted areas without cameras, leading to a strategic move by the property management team - they enacted what can be likened to a 'Feng Shui' trap rather than relying on traditional security measures. The result was the discovery that the culprit was none other than a 67-year-old former parking lot caretaker.Here's my interpretation and translation of the original news headline into English:"Guangzhou Mystery Car Scratcher Found Security Camera blind Spot, Caught After Targeting 14 Vehicles."Translation Note: This version maintains the essence of the original Chinese headline by emphasizing that a "mystery person" (the car scratcher) was identified after taking advantage of the absence of security cameras at certain spots in a parking lot. It also conveys how the situation led to the identification and apprehension of the suspect, who turned out to be a former caretaker at the site. The translation focuses on clarity and maintaining important details while keeping the tone appropriately neutral.I hope this meets your requirements!

Chiang Ching-kuo, at age 70, reminisced in his diary about the maxims he recited as a child: Climbing to heaven is hard, but asking others for help is even harder; Huanglian (a herb) is bitter, but poverty is even more so; spring ice is thin, human relationships are thinner still; the waters of江湖 are perilous, human intentions are even more treacherous. Knowing their difficulty, being content with hardship, enduring sparseness, understanding danger, one can navigate in society and adapt to change. Chiang said: These maxims speak of the wickedness of humanity, but there is also a bright side to human nature. Humanity's essence is good, but it often gets obscured by evil; the art of governance lies in stimulating the roots of goodness. #CulinaryScholarHistorian#

[What? Drinking Tea in Stainless Steel Cups Causes Chronic poisoning?!] There is a rumor that using a stainless steel cup to brew tea can release heavy metal "chromium" and pose the risk of chronic poisoning. According to experiments, the tea water is only weakly alkaline. Even if the protective layer inside the stainless steel wears off, it would need continuous soaking for ten days to transfer trace amounts of chromium. Using a合格stainless steel thermal cup will not affect health. But be cautious: do not use iron sand to clean the cup as it might cause heavy metals in the cup to leach out. @CCTV Finance
